          Yuva (young adult): Possess both the strength and the wisdom. A
          graha in this state gives full results.
        - >-
          Vriddha (old): Possess wisdom but lacks strength to execute.
          A graha in this state gives minimal results.

          Kumara (6-12), Yuva (12-18), Vriddha (18-24), Mrita (24-30). For the
          even rashis the order is reversed i.e. Mrita (0-6), Vriddha (6-12),

          When a graha comes very close to the Sun, it is not visible to us.
          Being out of sight, the graha becomes weak. Such a graha is
          called Combust. The closer the graha is to the Sun, the more will
          be its inauspicious results. The grahas moving away from the Sun after
          conjunction are less harmful than grahas moving towards conjunction
          with the Sun. When naturally benefic grahas combust, their benevolence
          decreases. When naturally malefic grahas are combust, their malefic
          influence increases. If the position strength of the combust graha
          is good or benefic/friendly grahas are aspecting it, then it will be
          less harmful and if the combust graha does not get good position
          strength and malefic/enemy grahas are aspecting it, then it will be
          more harmful.
        - >-
          To know the results of a combust graha, first know which house it is
          the lord of - it will harm the house of which it is the lord. The type
          of damage done depends on the graha and the house.
        - >-
          The internal characteristics of the combusted graha usually come to
          the fore. The internal characteristics of the grahas are as follows -
          Moon: mind, emotions, feelings, etc.; Mars: courage, morale,
          self-confidence, etc.; Mercury - intellect, talent, etc.; Jupiter:
          generosity, prudence, knowledge, etc.; Venus: beauty, desires, etc.;
          Saturn: cruelty, solitude, sacrifice, etc. Remember that the
          conjunction of Sun + Mercury forms Budhaditya Yoga.
        - >-
          Each house represents some external (such as body parts, relations
          and relatives, movable and immovable properties, clothes, business,
          job, etc.) and some internal (such as courage, intellect, morale,
          education, etc.) matters. If the lord of that house is combust, then
          the external matters are adversely affected. But the internal matters
          are minimally affected. Example - If Venus is combust in Capricorn
          Ascendant Kundali, then look at the fifth and tenth houses. External
          matters of the fifth house - children, kidney, liver and external
          matters of the tenth house - father, knees, business, job, position
          usually suffer.

          Every planet revolves around the Sun in its orbit. While the Earth
          takes 1 year to complete one revolution, Saturn takes 30 years to
          complete one revolution, because the distance of these planets from
          the Sun is different and the speed of the planets is also different.
          In the time taken by Saturn to complete one revolution, the Earth
          completes 30 revolutions. Due to this, sometimes it seems that the
          planet is not moving forward, but backwards. In such a condition,
          the planet is called retrograde.
        - >-
          Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are retrograde when they are in the 5th,
          6th, 7th or 8th sign from the Sun. Mercury and Venus are always
          found near the Sun and are retrograde there.
        - >-
          Benefic planets become more beneficial when they are retrograde.
          Malefic planets become more malefic when they are retrograde. If an
          exalted planet is retrograde, its strength increases, if a debilitated
          planet is retrograde, its strength also increases. It is not that a
          debilitated retrograde planet will give results like an exalted one,
          but its strength will definitely increase.
  remarks:
    - >-
      Rahu-Ketu are special. They are not assigned any exaltation-debilitation
      rashi. Most astrologers agrees that Rahu is exalted in Taurus and
      debilitated in Scorpio whereas Ketu is exalted in Scorpio and
      delibilitated in Taurus. Some believes that Rahu is exalted in Gemini
      and debilitated in Sagittarius whereas Ketu is exalted in Sagittarius
      and debilitated in Gemini. And then there are some who considers that
      both Rahu-Ketu are exalted in Scorpio and both are debilitated in Taurus.
      They believe that Sun-Saturn, Mars-Jupiter, and Mercury-Venus form
      opposite-pair. Similarly Moon forms the opposite-pair with Rahu-Ketu. 
    - >-
      Rahu-Ketu are not given lordship over any rashis though the predominant
      view is that Rahu and Ketu are lords of Aquarius and Aries respectively.
    - >-
      An exalted graha is very strong. Exaltation simply refers to its strength.
      It need not always give favorable and good results. If it is functional
      malefic, it can give very bad results.
    - >-
      A debilitated graha is not always bad. If the graha is acting as a
      functional malefic, debilitation takes away its strength to act in an
      malefic way.
    - A graha in its own rashi always give favorable results.
    - >-
      Planets revolve around the Sun in their orbits in the following order -
      Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Mercury and Venus
      revolve in the inner orbit of the Earth while Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
      revolve in the outer orbit. Planets which revolve in the outer orbit
      are combust when they are farthest from the Earth and become retrograde
      when they are closest to the Earth. That is, the outer planets do not
      combust and retrograde at the same time. This rule does not apply to
      the inner planets. They can be combust and retrograde at the same time.
      Even after moving at a very fast speed, Mercury takes about 30 days to
      transit in one sign because it retrogrades very often.
