          can give results only up to 25% of its potential.

        - >-
          Yuva (young adult): Possess both the strength and the wisdom. A
          graha in this state gives full results.
        - >-
          Vriddha (old): Possess wisdom but lacks strength to execute.

          When a graha comes very close to the Sun, it is not visible to us.
          This usually happens when that graha is farthest from us. Being out
          of sight and far from us, the graha becomes weak. Such a graha is
          called Combuted. The closer the graha is to the Sun, the more will
          be its inauspicious results. The grahas moving away from the Sun after
          conjunction are less harmful than grahas moving towards conjunction
          with the Sun. When naturally benefic grahas combust, their benevolence
          decreases. When naturally malefic grahas are combust, their malefic
          influence increases. If the position strength of the combust graha
          is good or benefic/friendly grahas are aspecting it, then it will be
          less harmful and if the combust graha does not get good position
          strength and malefic/enemy grahas are aspecting it, then it will be
          more harmful.
        - >-
          To know the results of a combust graha, first know which house it is
          the lord of - it will harm the house of which it is the lord. The type
          of damage done depends on the graha and the house.
        - >-
          The internal characteristics of the combusted graha usually come to
          the fore. The internal characteristics of the grahas are as follows -
          Moon: mind, emotions, feelings, etc.; Mars: courage, morale,
          self-confidence, etc.; Mercury - intellect, talent, etc.; Jupiter:
          generosity, prudence, knowledge, etc.; Venus: beauty, desires, etc.;
          Saturn: cruelty, solitude, sacrifice, etc. Remember that the
          conjunction of Sun + Mercury forms Budhaditya Yoga.
        - >-
          Each house represents some external (such as body parts, relations
          and relatives, movable and immovable properties, clothes, business,
          job, etc.) and some internal (such as courage, intellect, morale,
          education, etc.) matters. If the lord of that house is combust, then
          the external matters are adversely affected. But the internal matters
          are minimally affected. Example - If Venus is combust in Capricorn
          Ascendant Kundali, then look at the fifth and tenth houses. External
          matters of the fifth house - children, kidney, liver and external
          matters of the tenth house - father, knees, business, job, position
          usually suffer.

  remarks:
    - >-
      Rahu-Ketu are special. They are not assigned any exaltation-debilitation
      rashi. Most astrologers agrees that Rahu is exalted in Taurus and
      debilitated in Scorpio whereas Ketu is exalted in Scorpio and
      delibilitated in Taurus. Some believes that Rahu is exalted in Gemini
      and debilitated in Sagittarius whereas Ketu is exalted in Sagittarius
      and debilitated in Gemini. And then there are some who considers that
      both Rahu-Ketu are exalted in Scorpio and both are debilitated in Taurus.
      They believe that Sun-Saturn, Mars-Jupiter, and Mercury-Venus form
      opposite-pair. Similarly Moon forms the opposite-pair with Rahu-Ketu. 
    - >-
      Rahu-Ketu are not given lordship over any rashis though the predominant
      view is that Rahu and Ketu are lords of Aquarius and Aries respectively.
    - >-
      An exalted graha is very strong. Exaltation simply refers to its strength.
      It need not always give favorable and good results. If it is functional
      malefic, it can give very bad results.
    - >-
      A debilitated graha is not always bad. If the graha is acting as a
      functional malefic, debilitation takes away its strength to act in an
      malefic way.
    - A graha in its own rashi always give favorable results.
