          Bhavas 4, 7, and 10 are the kendra (angular) bhavas. Bhavas 5 and 9 are the
          trikona (trinal) bhavas. Some astrologers consider bhava 1 as kendra, some as
          trikona and some even as both. It is called lagna and has a special importance.
        - >-
          Kendras represents conscious, self directed efforts of the current life. Trikonas
          represents unconscious actions of the past and the next life.
        - >-
          A graha that is the owner of both a kendra and a trikona is called raj yoga karaka
          and bestows great benefits in its dasha period. If the owner of both a kendra and
          a trikona are posited in the same bhava or aspects each other, it is considered a
          good raj yoga and brings properity in the dasha period of at least one of them.
        - >-
          In any horoscope, all the trikonas are owned either by the grahas of the Sun
          (Sun, Moon, Mars and Jupiter) or the Saturn (Mercury, Venus and Saturn) family.

          The bhavas next to the kendras (2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th) are called panaphar. The
          bhavas next to the panaphars (3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th) are called Aapovilma/Apoklima.
          The grahas in kendras, panaphar, and aapovilma/apoklima give results in
          childhood/youth, middle age, and old age respectively.

          Bhavas 3, 6, 8 and 12 are called dussthanas. Bhavas 6, 8, and 12 are specially bad
          and are called Trik.
        - >-
          Bhavas 3, 6, 10 and 11 are called upachayas. The grahas posited in these bhavas show
          gradual improvements and growth.
        - >-
          Bhavas 3, 6 and 11 are called trishadaya. The owner of these bhavas never give good
          results in their dasha periods.

        - >-
          Dharma bhavas (1, 5, 9) have similar meanings with variations in intentions, intensity,
          and representations. They are harmonics of one another where the higher bhava is an
          altered image of the lower bhava. The same is true for artha, kama and moksha bhava.
          For example - dharma bhava 1, 5 and 9 means self, children, and grand-children
          respectively, artha bhava 6 and 10 represents service and profession respectively,
          kama bhava 3 and 11 represents younger and elder siblings respectively, and moksha
          bhava 8 and 12 means loss and end respectively.
        - >-
          Because every graha aspects the seventh bhava, the seventh bhava from any bhava is a
          reflection of that bhava.

        - >-
          A bhava which is Nth bhava away from bhava number N has a related and derived
          meaning of the bhava N. For example, both 5th and 9th (5th bhava from bhava 5)
          represent children/grandchildren, bhava 6th and 11th (6th from bhava 6) means
          disease/relief from disease, 8th and 3rd (8th away from bhava 8) indicates
          longevity.
        - >-
          The eighth bhava and the number 8 are indicators of longevity in astrology. Hence,
          the eighth bhava from any bhava limits the duration of the results (benefic/malefic)
          of the bhava.
        - >-
          In astrology, the twelfth bhava indicates the end/loss/detriment. Hence, the
          twelfth bhava from any bhava, symbolizes the end of the results (benefic/malefic)
          of the bhava. If the Lord of the tenth bhava is placed in the ninth bhava
          (twelfth from the tenth), the native has to face difficulties in his work,
          such natives are seldom seen satisfied in their work field. If the Lord of the
          third bhava is placed in the second bhava (twelfth from the third), the native
          usually does not have any younger brothers or sisters. A lack of confidence can
          also be seen in them and they remain shy in public life as well.
        - >-
          When the lord of a bhava is the same number of bhavas away from the bhava as
          that bhava is from the lagna, the good or bad things associated with the bhava
          will occur again and again. This situation is called bhavat bhavam.
        - >-
          Every Bhava indicates some meanings. Some of these are living beings while others
          are non-living. To analyze a bhava, see the position of the bhava lord.

          Bhavas 2 and 7 are called maraka. Bhava 3 and 8 represents longevity and bhava 2 and 7
          are 12 bhava (loss of longevity) away from bhava 3 and 8 respectively.
