          A graha gives good or bad results during its dasha period. It is not
          that a naturally benefic planet will benefit the native and a naturally
          malefic planet will harm the native. The functional nature depends on
          the ownership of the bhava in the horoscope. Use the following rules
          in determining the functional nature of a planet:
        - The lord of lagna (1st bhava) and triangle (5th, 9th bhava) is benefic
          where 9 > 5 > 1.
        - The lord of 3rd, 6th and 11th bhava is malefic where 3 < 6 < 11.
        - The lord of 6th, 8th and 12th bhava is malefic where 8 > 6 > 12.
        - The lord of the kendra (4th, 7th, 10th bhava) gives up its natural
          nature and becomes neutral; if the natural nature is benefic then
          it no longer remains benefic and if the natural nature is malefic
          then it no longer remains malefic. This is called Kendra-adhipati dosha.
        - If Moon is the lord of lagna then it is neutral.
        - If Sun or Moon is the lord of 2nd or 8th or 12th bhava then it is neutral.
        - If the lord of any house is situated in its own bhava then it is always benefic.


  remarks:
    - >-
      Some experts believe that the Moon is benefic N days before and after the
      full moon where 5 <= N <= 10.
    - >-
      Only Jupiter and Venus are truly benefics. Moon and Mercury are
      conditional benefics.
    - >-
      There are more malefics than benefics. Jyotish is a study of karma. Often
      the karmas are more selfish in nature than selfless service.
